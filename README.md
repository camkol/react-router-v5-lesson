## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- Navigate through various pages and links within the application.
- Utilize the search functionality to find relevant articles.
- Set up a new user profile with personalized details.
- Update or modify the display name of your profile.

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

- Install `react-router-dom` to add it to your React applications
- Enable routing by wrapping your application’s contents in the `BrowserRouter` component
- Make your code more concise by aliasing `BrowserRouter` component to `Router`
- Use the `Route` component to add routes to your application
- Use the `Route` component’s path prop to specify static routes (those without URL parameters, eg. `/users`) and dynamic routes (those with URL parameters, eg `/users/:userId`)
- Access the values of URL parameters using React Router’s `useParams` hook
- Declaratively redirect users by rendering React Router’s `Redirect` component
- Imperatively redirect users by accessing the `history` object via the `useHistory` hook and calling its `goForward`, `goBack`, and `push` methods.
- Access the value of query parameters using React Router’s `useLocation` hook
